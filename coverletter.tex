As the companies who has deep researching of sensing and sensors, I think IEE have great understand of 
how to offer a brilliant solution of self-driving cars.

I also got exited that you can offer the applicant applying new machine learning concepts to problems for autonomous driving funcitons.
For me, it is a precious experience to doing my master thesis in this topic. I will cherish this chance and do my best while I am working at yours.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
6+ years programming experience in C/C++ language, covered from microprocessor to Linux system programming.

Nowadays, I am focusing on applying data science technology in real world. 
It is an huge topic, I choose this direction based on my 6+ year's learning and observing in IoT area. 
I thinks IEE is a wonderful place for me to go into more on this field. 

As the preparation of working as a Machine Learning / Deep learning engineer, I have taken some course from my university.
For example, Cognitive algorthm, Kernel Method in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I also learned how to use python and Matlab in 
Machine Learning area. I am confident for get involved in a machine learning company.
